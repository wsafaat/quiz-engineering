## Setting Up the Application

### Source Data Setup
1. **Branch Checkout**: Switch to the `main` branch.
2. **Database Migration and Seeding**: Run migrations and seeders to populate sample data.
3. **API Calls**: Utilize the available APIs as specified in the API route documentation.

### Data Improvement with Modular Tables
1. **Branch Checkout**: Switch to the `improvement` branch.
2. **Run Migrations**: Execute the necessary migrations for table improvements.
3. **Testing**: Run tests to ensure data improvements are correct and verified.

## Recommendations

- For applications with larger datasets, consider running the table migrations as a background task to optimize performance.
